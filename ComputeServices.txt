b. Dedicated: Instances which are private.
c. On spot: data which is volatile... instance given on 
d. Reserved:

5. Instaces based upon their functioning:

a. Burstable
b. EBS OPtimised
c. Cluster Networking
d. Dedicated

6. USE CASE:

EDUREKA
Suppose it is using AWS as a service.

1. Anslysis of customers data: Burstable instance.... performance and analysis and customer data is not fixed .. it is Flexibile
2. Auto Response E-mail System: EBS OPtimised... i need quick response..
3. Search Engine and Browsing: Cluster Network instances........two things
4. Confidential data processing: Dedicated instances
